      <description>Support your teams&#39; decision making processes while giving them the space they need to function autonomously.  Autonomy is an important element of highly effective teams. As a leader, there&amp;rsquo;s a difficult balance to be struck between helping your teams get things done and providing the space and freedom that they need to solve problems themselves and own their solutions. Concepts like go slow to move fast can be used to help with this, but even still the core problem remains: how can a leader help teams solve difficult problems without reducing their ability to function autonomously?</description>

      <description>Background ðŸ”—Hi there! My name is Jordan Kaye, currently the Head of Technology for Belvedere Trading&amp;rsquo;s office in Boulder. My organization is focused on the research and development of fully automated low-latency trading systems.
As a leader, I believe that maintaining trust through honesty and consistent expectations is key to building high-performing teams and organizations.
As a technologist, I enjoy exploring different programming languages and paradigms to design robust and easily maintainable systems.</description>

      <description>Most decisions that you make are not nearly as important as your ability to change them in the future.  When designing systems, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to get caught up in the minutia of each decision that has to be made along the way. Technical systems may raise concerns about choosing the appropriate logging framework or determining the most effective concurrency model. Human systems may instead be concerned with how many meetings to hold, with whom, and how often.</description>

      <description>Words have meaning. It sounds obvious, but all too often it&amp;rsquo;s easy to find ourselves debating someone without first confirming that everyone is talking about the same thing. When I communicate, I like to use very specific and well-defined terms unambiguously. This lexicon serves as a quick reference to the definitions shared across all posts on this site.
I make no assertion that these definitions are universal!
System ðŸ”—A system takes its definition from Donella Meadows&#39; Thinking in Systems:</description>

      <description>Engineering teams can often improve their long-term development velocity by slowing down in the short term.  A shared misunderstanding ðŸ”—Technical debt is an often debated topic. Like most concepts in software, it isn&amp;rsquo;t particularly difficult to find arguments supporting opposite sides of the spectrum - in a single minute of searching I was able to find that some believe that technical debt doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist, while others feel that technical debt is the most important aspect of product development.</description>

      <description>Incremental progress on large projects can be achieved by developing functional stripes across the system&#39;s components.  When planning the delivery of a software project, there are many different strategies for handling the design and implementation of the system. At the extremes, we could attempt to complete a fully-specified design before writing any code at all, or we could start writing code without putting any thought towards our design and architecture at all.</description>

      <description>Welcome to the inaugural post of Organizing Chaos!
 I&amp;#39;m the type of person who loves to tinker with new pieces of technology. Recently, I&amp;#39;ve been experimenting with a few different technical ideas that I thought were worth writing about (stay tuned for future posts ðŸ˜‰), so naturally I started to get excited about the prospect of setting up a personal development blog for myself. After a weekend of research and experimentation, I&amp;#39;ve arrived at a very simple (yet effective!</description>
